                <h3>Bio</h3> <p> My name is Harshita Jain and I am a master`s student at University of Montreal with a major in Machine Learning.  
                I moved to Canada in August`22 for post graduation and used to live in India before. 
                
                Having 2+ years of work experience in the field of computer science, it is my honour to learn more deeply into this field now. Outside my work and studies, 
                I love playing sudoku and baking cakes. </p><br>

                <h3>Summary</h3> <p>Are algorithms sexist? This is a question that has been frequently appearing in the mass media, 
                 and the debate has typically been far from a scientific analysis. Gender-biased AI not only has 
                 immense impacts on individuals but also can contribute to setbacks in gender equality and women’s empowerment. 
                 The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) is significant in almost every industry. As many important decisions are now being automated by various 
                 AI applications, fairness is fast becoming a vital concern in AI. Moreover, the related literature and industry press suggest that AI systems are often 
                 biased towards gender. Thus, there is a need to better understand the contributing factors behind gender bias in AI, along with the current approaches 
                 taken to address it. </p><br><br>
