        IWD is Women Techmakers annual event campaign where our community hosts events all around the world during 
        the months of March and April in celebration of this moment. From big summits to smaller, 
        intimate gatherings, IWD is a time to host events that create connections, educate and inspire, and recognize 
        that we still have a ways to go to close the gender gap.


        The definition of to dare is to have the courage to try something new; to defy or challenge norms; 
        to be brave and willing take risks. For IWD 2023, Women Techmakers Ambassadors will be hosting events around the world with the theme “Dare To Be,” 
        empowering our community to have courage, to dream big and to be bold. #WTMDareToBe

        When we Dare to Be: we explore what it would mean to be audaciously bold, 
        to walk through the world with courage and confidence. We are willing to try something new, 
        to step outside of our comfort zone and to be unapologetically ourselves. 
        We don’t let societal or cultural roles or norms dictate who we are or how big we can dream.
