                <h3>Summary</h3><p> In this engaging presentation, I will share my personal journey and insights as a Ph.D. student navigating the dynamic landscape of both technology and academia. In this Personal Keynote, I am excited to delve into a rich tapestry of experiences that have shaped my journey, encompassing not only engineering research and event organization but also the transformative impact of global exploration and my role as a Women Tech Maker Ambassador (WTM). Join me as we explore the unique challenges and triumphs faced by women in these fields, discussing strategies for empowerment, breaking barriers, and fostering inclusivity. From my experiences contributing to panels on women in tech and academia, I will offer practical advice, share success stories, and inspire fellow scholars to embrace their roles as catalysts for positive change. Together, let's pave the way for a more equitable and diverse future in the realms of technology and academia. </p><br>
