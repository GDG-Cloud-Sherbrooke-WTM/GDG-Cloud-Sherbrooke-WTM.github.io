## IWD 2025 "Redefine Possible!"

This International Women's Day, we're not just celebrating women's incredible achievements in tech. We're actively shaping what comes next. #WTMRedefinePossible

The Women Techmakers program is focused on the theme "Redefine Possible" for International Women's Day 2025. This theme encourages women in tech to challenge the status quo, embrace innovation, and push the boundaries of what's achievable, particularly in the context of AI and emerging technologies.
