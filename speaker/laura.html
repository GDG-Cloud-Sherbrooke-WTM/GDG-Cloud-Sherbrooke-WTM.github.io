                My professional career has been developed, along almost 20 years between university and high
                school teaching, mathematics and statistics, mathematics training for primary and secondary
                teachers, creation of mathematics educational books for students with high abilities in primary
                school in Editorial Santillana (Chile), as well as mathematics courses for gifted students in primary
                school. I developed educational projects of mathematics leveling for high school and university
                students, statistical consulting and I have been and am an entrepreneur in EdTech.
                Since 2019, I have been shaping and validating my latest project, Civita Laurea, thanks to
                participating in project incubators such as Datapreneur at the Polytechnic University of
                Montreal, the District3 Validation and Launch and Grow programs at Concordia University, or the
                Digital Project Acceleration program, Digitech at CEIN, Navarra (Spain).
                I am currently developing a personal brand that brings together personalized math classes, a
                podcast in Spanish aimed at teachers, where education is discussed from the perspective of
                teaching experiences in Spanish-speaking countries, and the creation of an educational platform
                of personalized character and teaching thanks to the implementation of AI.
                As an active advocate for gender equality and the need for diversity and focus on social impact
                within the STEM world, I was an intern at AI4Good Lab in summer 2019 and participated as a
                volunteer in the organization at the annual AI in Social Impact conference, where also in the
                online 2020 version, I was able to present my vision in Education, talking about my future
                educational platform, Civita Laurea.
                I strongly believe in the importance of fostering diversity and inclusion in the EdTech world and
                I am dedicated and focused on being a reference of perseverance and courage, for young STEM
                girls interested in innovation and social impact for good, in Education. <br>

                <h3>Summary</h3> In this presentation, we will explore the significance of fostering female leadership and diversity
                in the fast-growing field of EdTech. Despite advancements in technology and education, women
                and other underrepresented groups continue to face significant challenges in the field. This
                presentation will address these challenges and emphasize the need for increased representation
                and involvement of women in STEM careers and educational entrepreneurship.
                The speaker, drawing on their personal experiences as a mathematician, teacher, and EdTech
                entrepreneur, will share their insights and provide examples that illustrate the impact of
                women's leadership and diversity in the industry. Attendees will gain a comprehensive
                understanding of the current landscape of EdTech, the challenges faced by women and
                underrepresented groups, and the opportunities for them to make a difference.
                At the end of the presentation, attendees will leave feeling inspired and equipped with the
                knowledge and resources necessary to pursue a career in EdTech and play an active role in
                promoting diversity and inclusiveness in the field. <br><br>
