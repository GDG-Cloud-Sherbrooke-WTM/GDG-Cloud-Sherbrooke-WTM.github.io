## This IWD I dare to be ---

The definition of to dare is to have the courage to try something new; to defy or challenge norms; to be brave and willing take risks. For IWD 2023, Women Techmakers Ambassadors will be hosting events around the world with the theme “Dare To Be,” empowering our community to have courage, to dream big and to be bold. #WTMDareToBe


When we Dare to Be: we explore what it would mean to be audaciously bold, to walk through the world with courage and confidence. We are willing to try something new, to step outside of our comfort zone and to be unapologetically ourselves. We don’t let societal or cultural roles or norms dictate who we are or how big we can dream.
The beauty of “Dare To Be” is that it is part of a larger sentence: you can dare to be bold, to be innovative, to be resilient - it can apply to so many aspects of our lives. And to approach the theme from this perspective - to allow anyone to imagine what they dare to be - we recognize that each of us has something unique to offer. Everyone brings a different set of skills and strengths to the table. And when we as a community are able to harness the diversity of all those skills and courageous actions, we are able to continue our goal to build a world where all women can thrive in tech.
