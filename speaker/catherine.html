              <h3>Bio</h3>  I am a software lead and researcher with more than a decade of applied research experience in a
              wide variety of development environments. My main expertise are in medical devices, computer vision and
              AR/VR, and my super power is turning academic research in actual deliverable products. I am currently a
              researcher at the National Research Council of Canada where I explore the convergence of gaming technology
              and medical devices, and where I help Canadian companies innovate and bring their products to market.

                <h3>Summary</h3><p> As much as we’d like to fill research work in tidy time boxes and iterations, the reality is that high-risk technical
                  innovation is seldom neat. In itself, the broad principles of agility are great fit for researchers. After all, this is
                  how engineers and scientists at the NASA have been working for decades, sometimes under the pretense of
                  waterfall development. And this is how most academic research is done. The basic principles - short iterations,
                  emphasis on competence, flexibility, teamwork - all that makes sense for research.</p><br>
                  <p> But the same time, formal agile methodologies were designed with more mainstream software development in
                  mind, things like accounting software and webpages. And there are several obstacles to applying them in a
                  research setting.</p><br>
                  <p> Researchers have, by the very nature of their work, conflicting loyalties. Teaching, publishing, inter-institution
                  collaborations, support roles in other teams because they’re the only expert on X… this can all get in the way of
                  development. Skills used for research typically take years to develop - you cannot simply “pitch in” and learn a
                  new skill over the week-end to help on a task that is getting late. In addition, projects are frequently dependent
                  on external resources, like limited availability hardware or lab equipment. And research projects often have to
                  take the backseat when critical production issues come up. All of this makes it challenging to apply a pure agile
                  approach.</p><br>
                  <p> In this talk, I’ll expose how research-oriented teams can adopt many principles of agility without getting stuck in
                  a rigid approach that is doomed to fail. We’ll talk about agile-inspired approaches that will help researchers
                  produce results more quickly without turning cynical or burning out.  </p><br>
