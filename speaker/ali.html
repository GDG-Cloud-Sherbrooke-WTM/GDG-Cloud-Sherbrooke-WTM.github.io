                <h2>Presentation Title</h2>   3 Good Night Stories in Bioinformatics for Rebel Girls <br>
                Summary:  Bioinformatics is a multidisciplinary area that applies computer science and mathematics tools to study biological phenomena 
                such as evolution. Thus, developing a project in this area requires an understanding of two scientific domains that seem far apart. 
                In this presentation, I will share three stories about projects in this area which would have never been possible without the rebel 
                spirit of the women involved. No prior knowledge of biology, computer science or mathematics is required. <br><br>

                <h2>Bio</h2> I am a PhD student in computer science with a research pathway in bioinformatics at the Department of Computer Science of 
                the University of Sherbrooke under the supervision of Professor Manuel Lafond. My research interests involve understanding the theoretical 
                and algorithmic challenges of evolutionary relationships and their impact on gene functionality. I am also a founding member of the Mexican 
                Bioinformatics Network (https://www.redmexicanadebioinformatica.org/) which is a non-profit organization whose aim is to make bioinformatics 
                accessible for Latin-American countries. Additionally, I am interested in science popularization, especially in the form of infographics. <br>
